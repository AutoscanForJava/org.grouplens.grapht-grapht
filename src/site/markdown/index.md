# Grapht Dependency Injector

Grapht is a [dependency injector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) for Java.
Unlike other DI containers that resolve dependencies lazily when instances are requested, Grapht
can compute dependency graphs in advance.  These graphs can be modified and analyzed prior to
instantiation to achieve a variety of effects.

## Publication

The design of Grapht is described in the following paper:
